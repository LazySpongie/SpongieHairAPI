description=[h1]Update 26/12/24[/h1]
description=Fixes a bug in the base game where the hair growth timer is reset when tying and untying hair
description=

description=[h1]Supports B41 and B42[/h1]
description=
description=This mod un-hardcodes some features from the base game and fixes some bugs.
description=
description=
description=[h2]All hairstyles of the same length are now available when cutting your hair in-game[/h2]
description=This removes the issue where you cannot switch from a vanilla hairstyle to a modded one (or between hairstyles from different mods).
description=
description=
description=This problem happens because Zomboid needs you to give a hairstyle it's own selection of "trim choices" that are available when using scissors. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any way to modify trim choices through LUA which makes it impossible to add new hairstyles to the trim choices of vanilla hairstyles or ones from other mods.
description=
description=This mod replaces the functions used when cutting your hair to remove the trim choices check entirely, so every hairstyle of the same length or shorter is available to choose.
description=
description=[hr]
description=Additionally, in the vanilla game a few hairstyles (specifically mohawks) are hardcoded to require hairgel - this mod allows modded hairstyles to use this feature, as well as optionally being able to switch to a flattened hairstyle after wearing a hat.
description=
description=[hr]
description=[h2]From my testing this mod should be compatible with Improved Hair Menu if you move this mod to after it in the load order[/h2]
